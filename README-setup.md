## About This Project

This project is based on the [Front End Mentor Job Listings and Filtering challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt)

## Project Setup

This project will be built using the following:
- React
- [SHopify's Checkout UI Component Library](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/components)
- TypeScript
- Storybook
- Tailwind


### Additional Configurations

After installing **sass** as per the [official React docs](<https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet>) I decided to also add CSS Reset which was the next step in the docs. They did mention that you might encounter the following eslint warning:

And provided the following suggestion:

So a quick google search led me to [turn off "Unkown at" elsint rule](https://flaviocopes.com/fix-unknown-at-rule-tailwind/) which resolved the warning.
